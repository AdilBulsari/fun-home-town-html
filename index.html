                    Dewsbury is situated between Leeds and Bradford 8 miles (13
                    km) to the north, Huddersfield a similar distance to the
                    south west, and Wakefield 6 mi (10 km) east. Its proximity
                    to these major urban centres, the M1 and M62 motorways and
                    its position on the Huddersfield Line, served by the
                    TransPennine Express, have contributed to its growth.
                    Junction of Northgate and Halifax Road Dewsbury is part of
                    the West Yorkshire Urban Area, although its natural
                    boundaries are not well-defined, with built up areas of the
                    town running into Batley, Heckmondwike and Ossett.
                    Geologically, the town is situated on rocks of the
                    Carboniferous Period, consisting of coal measures and
                    gritstones. Quaternary Period rock, glacial deposits and
                    gravels exist in the Calder Valley. Coal, sandstone and
                    gravel have been exploited commercially. Average rainfall is
                    100 cm per annum.[22] The town is dominated by hills,
                    notably Earlsheaton, Dewsbury Moor, Staincliffe and
                    Thornhill. The town centre is between 130 and 180 feet (40
                    and 55 metres) above sea level, rising to 360 ft (110 m) at
                    Earlsheaton and Batley Carr, and 755 ft (230 m) at Grange
                    Moor. The approach from Earlsheaton through the Wakefield
                    Road cutting, constructed in 1830[citation needed], is
                    dramatic with the view of the town centre in the Calder
                    Valley opening up.
